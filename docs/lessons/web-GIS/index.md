# Introduction to Web GIS

Making a beautiful map takes considerable effort. 
If your map is only for illustration, a printed or static digital version may be enough, but expectations have changed.

People now want maps that are engaging, interactive, and accessible from anywhere, on any device with internet.
[Web GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_GIS) can help with that because it combines the power of the browser and GIS tools for capturing, storing, analyzing spatial data, and encouraging exploration to provide deeper insight.

Creating your own [web mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mapping) applications can be a rewarding experience, but depending on your goals and company's needs, it can get quite technical.

However, the barrier to entry has lowered significantly in recent years thanks to the rise of various web mapping libraries, [cloud services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), evolution of the modern web browser, [frontend web development frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development), and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).

In the next few chapters, we'll cover some key considerations for creating your very own successful web mapping application by:

- Choosing a web mapping library that suits your needs
- Deciding on whether to write an app with plain JavaScript or a frontend web development framework and build tool
- Evaluating where to host your prepared data (client-side or server-side)

In fact, this website can be considered a Web GIS application, as it uses various web mapping libraries to display interactive maps and spatial data.

::: tip TIP for web development beginners
Before you proceed, make sure you have a basic understanding of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript).
MDN Web Docs, by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), are a great resource for [learning web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development).
They cover topics like the [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) (DOM), creating [your first website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website), understanding [web standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Web_standards), [asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS) and more. Learning these fundamentals will help you as a software developer or GIS professional better understand the concepts discussed in the following chapters.

::: tip TIP for GIS beginners
If you're new to GIS concepts, consider reviewing the previous lessons about [projections](/lessons/projections), [different spatial data types](/lessons/spatial-data), [types of maps](/lessons/map-types), [scale](/lessons/scale), and [classifying data](/lessons/classification).

<!-- ## Core concepts
- Web map client: code running in the browser (Leaflet, OpenLayers, Mapbox GL JS).
- Map tile services: pre-rendered raster tiles (XYZ/TileJSON, WMTS) for fast basemap display.
- Map servers and services: dynamic rendering and data publishing (GeoServer, MapServer, ArcGIS Server).
- Vector data & formats: GeoJSON, TopoJSON, vector tiles (Mapbox Vector Tiles).
- Projection & CRS: coordinate reference systems (Web Mercator / EPSG:3857 is common for web maps).
- APIs and protocols: WMS, WMTS, WFS, REST APIs, and Mapbox/Google style APIs.
- Styling & interactivity: client-side style rules, popups, feature querying, layer control.
- Data hosting & performance: tile caching, CDN, spatial indexing, and simplification.

## Typical Web GIS workflow
1. Prepare spatial data (clean, attribute, choose projection).
2. Publish data (static files like GeoJSON or through a map server).
3. Provide basemap tiles (public or self-hosted).
4. Build client UI (map view, controls, legend, popups).
5. Optimize (tile caching, vector tiling, reduce payloads).
6. Deploy (host files, APIs, and services; secure endpoints). -->
