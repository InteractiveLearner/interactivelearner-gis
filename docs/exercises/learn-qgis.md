# Learn QGIS

## Next Steps and QGIS
Now that you've soaked up all the foundational knowledge from this site, the next step is to go deeper by learning how to use [QGIS](https://qgis.org/). 
QGIS is a free and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) desktop software that enables you to create, analyze, and print maps.
In the exercises, we'll put what you've learned into practice by working on making our own maps!

## Downloading QGIS
Lets first start by [Downloading QGIS](https://qgis.org/download/).
Feel free to donate, otherwise click "skip and go to downloads".
Select the correct download for your platform.
If you are using windows, I recommend the "Long term version for windows" download.
After downloading, follow the download instructions to complete the installation.

## How to collect data for your map
Now that we have QGIS installed, how do we download data to add to our map?
Knowing where to find good geospatial data might take some time but is important.Listed below are different websites that you can use to download data. 
This data can then be used in QGIS when creating your maps.
