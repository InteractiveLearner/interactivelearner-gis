# Sharing your map

Now that you have a map, you probably want to learn how to share it!
In this exercise, we will be learning how to do this with GitHub Pages.
GitHub Pages allows you to host your map online for anyone to view.

## GitHub account

**Note:** 
If you have a GitHub account, you can skip this section.

First, you will need to make a GitHub account.
Go to: [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and create an account.
After you create an acoount, the next step is to create a repository, or a repo for short.
To learn more about GitHub and repositories, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories).

## GitHub repository

**What is a GitHub repository?** <br>
A repository is like the central hub for a project.
The repository will contain all of your files for the project.
By making a repository, you can: track changes to your project, allow for multiple people to collaboration on your project, allow you to show different versions of your project, and you can even make it public or private.

Let's start by creating a GitHub repository.
Now that your account has been created, click on the green **"New"** button.
At the top it should say **"Create a new repository."**
You will see your GitHub name with an empty repository name.
Create an appropriate name for your project here.
Next, create a small description of your project in the **"description"** text box.
After, click the green **"Create repository"** button towards the bottom.

## Uploading files to our repository

Now that we have an empty project repository, we want to upload our current files into it.
Click the **"Add file"** button next to the green **"<> Code"** button.
Next, click "upload files" and go to your files on your computer.
find the folder containing all of your project files.
This file should contain your QGIS save file (ending with the .qgz extension), along with other saved layers.
Drag this folder where it says "Drag files here to add them to your repository."
Next, click on the green **"Commit changes"** button after they have all loaded.

**TODO**
finish here.

## Setting up GitHub pages

Now that you have a repository, lets set up GitHub pages.
GitHub pages allows you to have one "main" site per account and many "project" sites per account. <br>
**Main site example:** 
github-username.github.io <br>
**Project site example:** 
github-username.github.io/project-name

Towards the top of the screen, you should see a **"Settings"** tab.
Click on it.
