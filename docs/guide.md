# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Interactive Learner GIS is a resource for both new and experienced GIS professionals. 
Each page contains a brief crash course on a specific topic, providing critical knowledge and skills. 
Lessons are ordered in a way that builds on previous knowledge, so it is recommended that you follow the sequence for the best learning experience.

## Background on GIS and mapping

Maps help us make sense of the world. They show us where things are, how they are connected, and allow us to investigate patterns in our environment. Geographic information systems (GIS) are effective for for creating, analyzing, and sharing maps.

Marks and channels are fundamental concepts in [data visualization](/lessons/data-visualization) that help to visually represent data. These concepts are used in mapping to effectively convey spatial information.

- [Marks](/lessons/data-visualization#marks) like points, lines, and areas show locations, routes, and boundaries.
- Color, size, and shape are examples of [channels](/lessons/data-visualization#channels) that aid in the recognition of differences and patterns.

There are different [types of maps](/lessons/map-types), each serving a specific purpose:

- [Reference maps](/lessons/map-types#reference-maps) show general locations, like road maps.
- [Thematic maps](/lessons/map-types#thematic-maps) focus on specific topics, like population or climate.

To represent our round world on paper or screens, we can use [projections](/lessons/projections) that flatten the globe. Every projection comes with its own set of trade-offs and introduces some form of distortion.

The [scale](/lessons/scale) of a map indicates how much detail it shows. For example, a map of a city block provides more detail than a map of the entire country.

Finally, we [classify data](/lessons/classification) into categories to make patterns easier to see, such as grouping cities by population size.

## Motivation for this site

[Omar Kawach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarkawach/) originally created this site at [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) as a capstone project for the [Geomatics](https://www.uvic.ca/undergraduate/programs/undergraduate-programs/pages/geography-and-computer-science.php) program to promote map literacy.

Map readers vary in levels of map literacy. 
To bridge the gap between mapmakers and map readers, the site aims to promote map literacy and critical thinking by concentrating on improving map reader spatial inquiry competencies in a self-paced learning environment.

In addition, the site is meant to act as a knowledge base that contributors can build upon.
